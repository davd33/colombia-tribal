* STORY The openning

After all the ceremonies that you have gone through as a baby shaman
you suddenly wake up in consciousness and realize that everything is
dark. You want to open the eyes as hard as possible but only can you
hear the song of water passing a couple of meters away from you.

A voice says: "Welcome to school! haha"

You: "To school?"

The voice: "Indeed, here will you learn all the ways of the shamans,
so that you can later and for ever guide our tribe into the present."

As the voice stops, you start hearing new noises near where you
previously heard a current of water.

ACTIONS:
GOTO, Walk to river, The river
ASK, Ask to the voice to explain more, The voice explains more
