#+TITLE: Colombia Tribal

A story game in the tribal epoch of Colombia.

* Development

** Story line and actions

We will be one software dev and a politician student developing this
game, one of us is clearly not going to learn how to manage with lisp
conses even for writing configuration files. Thus I think that using
ORG files to write all the story logic is a better idea. It will still
need some rigor from the non-devs but is going to be ok with a bit of
my help.

These ORG files will need some syntax in order to be interpreted by
the game text engine.

** Javascript

The game will firstly use static HTML pages with links to other pages.

We could as a bonus implement an optional javascript feature that
would make the game nicer to play on a remote web-server. The
javascript option must not be necessary to play the game so that
everyone can play it!
